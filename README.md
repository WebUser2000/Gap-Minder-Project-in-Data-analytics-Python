# Gap-Minder-Project-in-Data-analytics-With-Python
The Gapminder Project in Data Analytics with Python is a data visualization and analytics project that typically involves exploring and analyzing socio-economic and health-related indicators of different countries over time. The project is inspired by the Gapminder Foundation, which provides open data on global development trends.
Steps in the Project:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, filtering relevant data, and formatting it for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generating summary statistics and exploring relationships between different indicators.
Data Visualization:
Scatter plots (Country vs. Life Expectancy)
Line charts ( population growth trends)
Histograms and boxplots for distribution analysis
Animated bubble charts (like Hans Roslingâ€™s famous presentations)
Statistical Analysis: Correlation analysis, trend forecasting, and clustering of countries based on economic and health indicators.
